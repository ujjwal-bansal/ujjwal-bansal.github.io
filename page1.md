Canberra

### Why Canberra?
I didn't really choose Canberra as much as the institution I was going to be a
part of. The Australian National University was ranked number one in Australia
in those years for higher education in physics. Academic excellence being my 
first priority at the time, I skipped skipped Sydney and Melbourne to end up in 
the bush capital.
